Context Management Example

OmniCoreAgent automatically manages context for long-running conversations.
This prevents token exhaustion and keeps agents running indefinitely.

Features covered:
- Context management configuration
- Token budget mode
- Summarize and truncate strategy
- Monitoring context usage

Build on: agent_configuration.py
This is critical for production agents with long conversations.

Run:
    python cookbook/getting_started/agent_with_context_management.py
