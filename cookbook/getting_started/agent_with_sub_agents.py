Sub-Agents Example

OmniCoreAgent can manage sub-agents for complex, multi-step tasks.
The parent agent automatically delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents.

Features covered:
- Creating specialized sub-agents
- Passing sub-agents to parent agent
- Automatic task delegation

Build on: agent_with_metrics.py
This is the foundation for building multi-agent systems.

Run:
    python cookbook/getting_started/agent_with_sub_agents.py

1. CREATE SPECIALIZED AGENTS:
   researcher = OmniCoreAgent(name="researcher", ...)
   analyst = OmniCoreAgent(name="analyst", ...)

2. PASS TO PARENT AGENT:
   coordinator = OmniCoreAgent(
       name="coordinator",
       sub_agents=[researcher, analyst],  # <-- Pass list here
   )

3. PARENT DISCOVERS SUB-AGENTS:
   - The parent sees AVAILABLE SUB AGENT REGISTRY in its context
   - It can delegate tasks using agent_name and parameters
   - Sub-agent results are returned to the parent

WHEN TO USE SUB-AGENTS:
- Complex reasoning or analysis tasks
- Domain-specific expertise needed
- Multi-step workflows
- Parallel processing of multiple tasks

See cookbook/workflows/ for SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, RouterAgent patterns!
