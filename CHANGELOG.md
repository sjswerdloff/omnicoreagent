# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.18] - 2025-06-19

### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed local ChromaDB support for performance optimization
  - Local ChromaDB fallback system has been completely removed
  - Users must now explicitly configure a vector database provider
  - No more automatic fallback to local storage
  - This eliminates the 81+ second startup delay from ChromaDB Rust bindings
- **Performance Improvement**: Vector database modules now load only when explicitly needed
  - Lazy loading prevents unnecessary imports during package initialization
  - Faster startup when vector DB is disabled
  - Better resource management

### Added
- **Required Configuration**: Users must set `OMNI_MEMORY_PROVIDER` to one of:
  - `qdrant-remote` (recommended default)
  - `chroma-remote` 
  - `chroma-cloud`
- **Clear Error Messages**: Better feedback when vector DB configuration is missing

### Removed
- Local ChromaDB persistence and warmup system
- Automatic fallback mechanisms
- Module-level vector DB initialization
- ChromaDB local client type

### Migration Guide
- **Before**: `ENABLE_VECTOR_DB=true` would automatically use local ChromaDB
- **After**: Must set both `ENABLE_VECTOR_DB=true` AND `OMNI_MEMORY_PROVIDER=qdrant-remote` (or other provider)
- **Impact**: Faster startup, but requires explicit configuration
